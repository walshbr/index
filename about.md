I am an Assistant Professor in the [English Department at Washington State University](https://english.wsu.edu/), and I also regularly teach in the [Digital Technology and Culture (DTC)](https://dtc.wsu.edu/) program. I am particularly inspired by the Romantic-era printmaker William Blake, who rebelled against the commercial practices of his day while combining older and newer technologies to dispel the industrial temporalities of standardization and efficiency emerging during his life. My first book, [*William Blake and the Digital Humanities: Collaboration, Participation, and Social Media*](https://www.routledge.com/William-Blake-and-the-Digital-Humanities-Collaboration-Participation/Whitson-Whittaker/p/book/9780415656184) was co-written with Jason Whittaker and published in 2012 by Routledge. The book explores artists adapting the work of Blake as a reaction to the emergence of digital humanities technologies and methodologies like media remix, archival curation, and data visualization. My second book *[Steampunk and Nineteenth-Century Digital Humanities: Literary Retrofuturisms, Media Archaeologies, Alternate Histories](https://www.routledge.com/Steampunk-and-Nineteenth-Century-Digital-Humanities-Literary-Retrofuturisms/Whitson/p/book/9781138859500)* examines the popular subculture as an alternate history methodlogy juxtaposing the fantasies of Victorian scientists, industrialists, and labor activists with recent developments in the digital humanities like media archaeology, social media, and maker culture. 

I believe that stories can help us struggle against our prejudices, learn to manage our anxieties and traumas more effectively, and transform who we think we are. I read every evening and encourage my students to do the same. 

The technologies and ecologies making up our world, on the other hand, are strange non-human entities whose processes exceed our understanding of them, and yet are an intimate part of our lives and bodies. 

I live with two cats Nemo and Buddha, and an inspiring person named Leeann.
